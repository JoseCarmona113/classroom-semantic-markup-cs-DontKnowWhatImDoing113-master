My Super Fun Web Page

<!-- description -->
Hi, this is my super awesome fun web page where the content makes no sense but there is a lot of it. So let's get into some business that you can learn from.

<!-- title for next section -->
This is a list of colors that are colorful in no particular order:
<!-- list with no order -->
Red
Teal
Purple
Daffodil
Lime Green
Magenta
Atomic Tangerine

<!-- title for next section -->
This is a list of movies ranked from most-awesome to not-as-awesome
<!-- list with specific order -->
Anything with Bill Murray in it
Life Aquatic

<!-- title for next section -->
Let's look at some images:

<!-- title for next item -->
Cats Are Awesome!
<!-- description of next item -->
Look at this one:
<!-- add appropriate image here (don't forget alt attribute!) -->
<!-- title for next item -->
Doggos Are Pretty Cool Too
<!-- description of next item -->
This doggo is a tricky doggo:
<!-- add appropriate image here (don't forget alt attribute!) -->
<!-- title for next section -->
Sometimes people say important things
<!-- description of next section -->
You need to document important things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary.
<!-- quote -->
Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose. - Bill Gates

<!-- title for next section -->
When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do
<!-- description -->
At least, not anymore...

<!-- title for next item -->
Want bold text?
<!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
There's a wrong way and a right way. Always use the right way!

<!-- title for next item -->
Maybe you need some italics?
<!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
Again, it used to be done like this. This is wrong. This is the right way.

<!-- title for next item -->
Separation of concerns
<!-- description -->
The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content. It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!

<!-- title for next section -->
Links
<!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from place to place on the internet.

<!-- title for next section -->
Sections
<!-- go back through and group each section correctly
     stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for this
